# HTML5 Tags

| Tag            | Category                      | Description |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| `<article>`    | Semantic (Sectioning Content) | The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. |
| `<aside>`      | Semantic (Sectioning Content) | The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography. |
| `<audio>`      | Media                         | An audio element represents a sound or audio stream. |
| `<bdi>`        | Structural                    | The bdi element represents a span of text that is to be isolated from its surroundings for the purposes of bidirectional text formatting. |
| `<canvas>`     | Graphics                      | The canvas element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images on the fly. |
| `<command>`    | Structural (Deprecated)       | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<data>`       | Semantic                      | The data element represents its contents, along with a machine-readable form of those contents in the value attribute. |
| `<datalist>`   | Form                          | The datalist element represents a set of option elements that represent predefined options for other controls. In the rendering, the datalist element represents nothing and it, along with its children, should be hidden. |
| `<details>`    | Semantic (Summary & Details)  | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<dialog>`     | Structural (Interative)       | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<embed>`      | Media                         | The embed element provides an integration point for an external (typically non-HTML) application or interactive content. |
| `<figcaption>` | Semantic (Figure)             | The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the figcaption element's parent figure element, if any. |
| `<figure>`     | Semantic (Figure)             | The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document. |
| `<footer>`     | Semantic (Sectioning Related) | The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like. |
| `<header>`     | Semantic (Sectioning Related) | The header element represents introductory content for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A header typically contains a group of introductory or navigational aids. |
| `<hgroup>`     | Semantic (Sectioning Related) | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<keygen>`     | Form                          | The keygen element represents a key pair generator control. When the control's form is submitted, the private key is stored in the local keystore, and the public key is packaged and sent to the server. |
| `<main>`       | Semantic (Sectioning Related) | The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application. |
| `<mark>`       | Semantic                      | The mark element represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context. When used in a quotation or other block of text referred to from the prose, it indicates a highlight that was not originally present but which has been added to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text that might not have been considered important by the original author when the block was originally written, but which is now under previously unexpected scrutiny. When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a part of the document that has been highlighted due to its likely relevance to the user's current activity. |
| `<math>`       | Foreign                       | The math element from the MathML namespace falls into the embedded content, phrasing content, and flow content categories for the purposes of the content models in this specification. |
| `<menu>`       | Structural (Interative)       | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<menuitem>`   | Structural (Interative)       | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<meter>`      | Structural                    | The meter element represents a scalar measurement within a known range, or a fractional value; for example disk usage, the relevance of a query result, or the fraction of a voting population to have selected a particular candidate. |
| `<nav>`        | Semantic (Sectioning Content) | The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links. |
| `<output>`     | Form                          | The output element represents the result of a calculation or user action. |
| `<picture>`    | Media                         | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<progress>`   | Structural                    | The progress element represents the completion progress of a task. The progress is either indeterminate, indicating that progress is being made but that it is not clear how much more work remains to be done before the task is complete (e.g. because the task is waiting for a remote host to respond), or the progress is a number in the range zero to a maximum, giving the fraction of work that has so far been completed. |
| `<rb>`         | Structural (Ruby)             | The rb element marks the base text component of a ruby annotation. When it is the child of a ruby element, it doesn't represent anything itself, but its parent ruby element uses it as part of determining what it represents. |
| `<rp>`         | Structural (Ruby)             | The rp element is used to provide fallback text to be shown by user agents that don't support ruby annotations. One widespread convention is to provide parentheses around the ruby text component of a ruby annotation. |
| `<rt>`         | Structural (Ruby)             | The rt element marks the ruby text component of a ruby annotation. When it is the child of a ruby element or of an rtc element that is itself the child of a ruby element, it doesn't represent anything itself, but its ancestor ruby element uses it as part of determining what it represents. |
| `<rtc>`        | Structural (Ruby)             | The rtc element marks a ruby text container for ruby text components in a ruby annotation. When it is the child of a ruby element it doesn't represent anything itself, but its parent ruby element uses it as part of determining what it represents. |
| `<ruby>`       | Structural (Ruby)             | The ruby element allows one or more spans of phrasing content to be marked with ruby annotations. Ruby annotations are short runs of text presented alongside base text, primarily used in East Asian typography as a guide for pronunciation or to include other annotations. In Japanese, this form of typography is also known as furigana. Ruby text can appear on either side, and sometimes both sides, of the base text, and it is possible to control its position using CSS. A more complete introduction to ruby can be found in the Use Cases & Exploratory Approaches for Ruby Markup document as well as in CSS Ruby Module Level 1. |
| `<section>`    | Semantic (Sectioning Content) | The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. The theme of each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the section element. |
| `<source>`     | Media                         | The source element allows authors to specify multiple alternative media resources for media elements. It does not represent anything on its own. |
| `<summary>`    | Semantic (Summary & Details)  | (Not a W3 HTML5 element) |
| `<svg>`        | Foreign                       | The svg element from the SVG namespace falls into the embedded content, phrasing content, and flow content categories for the purposes of the content models in this specification. |
| `<template>`   | Semantic                      | The template element is used to declare fragments of HTML that can be cloned and inserted in the document by script. |
| `<time>`       | Semantic                      | The time element represents its contents, along with a machine-readable form of those contents in the datetime attribute. The kind of content is limited to various kinds of dates, times, time-zone offsets, and durations, as described below. |
| `<track>`      | Media                         | The track element allows authors to specify explicit external timed text tracks for media elements. It does not represent anything on its own. |
| `<video>`      | Media                         | A video element is used for playing videos or movies, and audio files with captions. |
| `<wbr>`        | Structural                    | The wbr element represents a line break opportunity. |
